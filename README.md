# Ryan | Full Stack Developer

Hey there! üëã I'm Ryan, a full stack developer who enjoys building things that actually work (most of the time). I specialize in web and mobile development, and I've been known to write code that doesn't break... usually.

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Do

I'm a **Flutter Full Stack Developer** and **Web Full Stack Developer** who loves creating applications from the ground up. Whether it's a sleek web app or a mobile application, I enjoy the entire process from backend APIs to pixel-perfect UIs.

### My Tech Arsenal

**Frontend Stuff**
- React.js & Next.js - because who doesn't love a good React hook
- Flutter - my go-to for cross-platform mobile development (seriously, I love this framework)
- React Native - another solid option for mobile development
- TypeScript - because JavaScript with types is just better (though JS is cool too)
- Tailwind CSS - utility classes are life

**Backend Magic**
- Node.js & Express.js - TypeScript and JavaScript, both have their place
- API development - REST APIs that actually make sense
- Database design - making data play nice together
- Authentication systems - keeping the bad guys out

**Mobile Development**
- Flutter framework - cross-platform development done right
- Performance optimization - because nobody likes slow apps
- CI/CD automation - because manual deployments are so last decade

## üöÄ Some Things I've Built

**AnymeX** - A Flutter multi-tracking app that supports multiple services like AniList, MyAnimeList, and SIMKL. It tracks your anime/manga progress and somehow managed to get 40K+ downloads without crashing too much.

Plus a bunch of other projects that range from "pretty decent" to "I'm actually proud of this one."

## üéØ Currently Working On

- Building scalable applications that don't fall over when more than 10 people use them
- Exploring advanced Flutter patterns (because there's always more to learn)
- Creating APIs that other developers won't curse at
- Occasionally fixing bugs that I definitely didn't create

## üí¨ Let's Chat

If you want to talk about code, collaboration, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. I promise I'm more fun than my commit messages suggest.
